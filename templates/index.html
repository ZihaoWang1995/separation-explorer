      <h1>Material explorer for binary separations</h1>
        
      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      
      <p>
          The dataset below is generated by calculating three key performance
          indicators (KPI): initial Henry constant, point uptake and working capacity
          from publicly available isotherms from the NIST ISODB. Each point below
          represents a material from the ISODB.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Using the separation explorer</h3>

      <p>
          Select two gases from the drop-down list below. Materials with available
          isotherms on these probes are then displayed in the dashboard. 
          Only the materials where KPI can be calculated are plotted.
          Panning, zooming can be done using the mouse; reset the graph by pressing the 
          reset button in the upper-right corner.
      </p>
      <p>
          The color of the points represents by number of available isotherms, with 
          grey denoting only one datapoint available.
          If clicked, the material is highlighted in all graphs and the confidence
          range of the KPI is displayed as dotted lines.
          Multiple points can be selected through the use of the table or by 
          shift-clicking graph points.
      </p>
      <p>
          The uptake graph shows the amount adsorbed a particular pressure
          while the working capacity is the difference between uptake at
          two pressures. The sliders below the graphs can be used to change
          the pressure selected for each respective KPI.
      </p>
      <p>
          Once a material has been selected, the graphs at the bottom
          of the page display the isotherms from the ISODB database 
          that have been used for calculations, as well as the median
          for each point. Click on them to be directed
          to the NIST page for the corresponding publication which
          contains detailed information about the isotherm source.
