      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      
      <p>
          The dataset below is generated by calculating three key performance
          indicators: initial Henry's constant, working capacity and point uptake
          from publicly available isotherms from the NIST ISODB. The
          points displayed are means of multiple values.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Using the separation explorer</h3>

      <p>
          Select the two gases to investigate from the drop-down list.
          Materials with available isotherms on these probes are then plotted
          in the graphs below. 
          The color of the points is determined by number of available isotherms.
          Hover over a point to display the material name.
          If clicked, the adsorbent is highlighted in all graphs and the standard 
          deviation of the calculation is displayed as dotted lines, as well as
          several details in the adjoining table.
      </p>

      <p>
          The uptake graph shows the amount adsorbed a particular pressure
          while the working capacity is the difference between uptake at 
          two pressures.
          The sliders below can be used to change the pressures for the uptake
          or for the working capacity.
          Graph only shows materials where the loading can be calculated.
